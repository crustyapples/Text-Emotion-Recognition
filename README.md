# Project Setup Instructions

This README provides a step-by-step guide to setting up your Python project. Follow these instructions to initialize a virtual environment, install necessary dependencies, and run preprocessing scripts.

## Initialising a Virtual Environment

To isolate the project dependencies, it's recommended to use a virtual environment. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:** Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:** Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install Dependencies:** Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running Preprocessing Scripts

To run the preprocessing scripts, follow these steps:


1. **Run the Script:** Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python tweets_emotions/preprocessing.py
   python emo2019/preprocessing.py
